// AVL Tree Data Structure

/*

    AVL trees guarantee **O(log n)** time for insertion, deletion, and lookup, by ensuring that the tree remains balanced at all times.

        Balance Factor: height(left subtree) - height(right subtree)

        Valid balance factor values:
            -1: Right subtree is taller
            0: Both subtrees are equal
            +1: Left subtree is taller

        If the balance factor becomes less than -1 or greater than +1, the tree needs rebalancing.
