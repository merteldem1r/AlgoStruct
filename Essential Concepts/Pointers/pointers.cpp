#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Heaps are memory areas allocated to each program. Memory allocated to heaps can be dynamically allocated, unlike memory allocated to stacks.

// Program should have a pointer on the Stack to access anything in the Heap

/*
Advantages of heap memory:

* Heap doesnâ€™t have any limit on memory size.
* It allows you to access variables globally.
* Garbage collection runs on the heap memory to free the memory used by the object.
* The heap method is also used in the Priority Queue.

Disadvantages of heap memory:

* It takes too much time to execute compared to the stack.
* It takes more time to compute.
* It can provide the maximum memory an OS can provide
* Memory management is more complicated in heap memory as it is used globally.
