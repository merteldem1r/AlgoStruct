#include <iostream>

// Generate Binary Search Tree from POSTORDER traversal

/*
    Actually the procedure is the same as in the file: Algorithms/Binary-Tree/generateTreeFromTraversals.cpp
    
    As we know from above code to generat the Binary Tree we need either (Inorder + Postorder) OR (Inorder + Preorder)
    Same can be applied to the Binary Search Tree 

    BUT! We can also generate Binary Search Tree only knowing one TRAVERSAL without knowing INORDER
    Either POSTORDER or PREORDER being only one can be enough to generate Binary Search Tree
