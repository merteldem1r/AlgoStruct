# Data Structures and Algorithms with C & C++

![Data Structures Algorithms](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7676b3b8-edfa-4cd4-b3f2-2e7059ae0572)

DSA | Data Structures and Algorithms using C & C++ Essential Concepts like Pointers, OOP, Structures, References etc. with well explained comment lines and Readme files. Implementing all commonly used Data Structure from scratch and their Algorithms.

**Project divided into 3 topics. Essential Concepts, Data Structures and Algorithms. Each topic contain code examples with explained comment lines and Readme file.**

## 1) Essential Concepts of C++

- Essential concepts of C & C++ before diving into DSA. Arrays, Structures, OOP, Pointer and a lot more with explanation and example code.

### 1.1) Array Basics

- Representation of Arrays in C & C++
- Declaring and initializing dynamic and static arrays

### 1.2) Structures

Structures in C++ are user defined data types which are used to store group of items of non-similar data types.

- Understanging the concept of Structure in C++
- Creating struct objects in Stack and heap.
- Manipulating with members of the structure.

### 1.3) Pointers

Pointers are symbolic representations of addresses. They enable programs to simulate call-by-reference as well as to create and manipulate dynamic data structures. Iterating over elements in arrays or other data structures is one of the main use of pointers.

The address of the variable you’re working with is assigned to the pointer variable that points to the same data type (such as an int or string).

- Difference between Heap and Stack
- Creating and allocating memory on Heap and seeing difference between C style and C++ style

### 1.4) Reference

  When a variable is declared as a reference, it becomes an alternative name for an existing variable. A variable can be declared as a reference by putting ‘&’ in the declaration.

  - Creating references to variables
  - Manipulating values of the variables with references
  - Use cases of references in for each blocks
